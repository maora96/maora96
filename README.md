# Hello there, I'm Marina :cat:

I'm an aspiring fullstack developer from Brazil. I love building things and solving problems :heart_eyes_cat: I come from Design and still have an infatuation with everything UI, so pretty but functional & efficient are a must for me :relaxed:

I also spend too much time playing League, Runeterra, cRPGS/RPGS and visual novels. I love drawing and writing, too :heart_eyes_cat:

I'm currently a student @ [Cubos Academy](https://cubos.academy) for Fullstack Development & @ [UNIFACS](https://www.unifacs.br/) for Design.
