# Hello there, I'm Marina 

I'm a fullstack developer from Brazil. I love building things and solving problems. I come from Design and still have an infatuation with everything UI/UX, so pretty but functional & efficient are a must for me.

I also spend too much time playing League, Runeterra, cRPGS/RPGS and visual novels. I love drawing and writing, too.

I'm was a student @ [Cubos Academy](https://cubos.academy) for Fullstack Development & @ [UNIFACS](https://www.unifacs.br/) for Design.
